# NPM Dashboard

A simple Flask-based dashboard that reads from your Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) SQLite database and shows active proxy domains in a web UI.

## 🚀 Features

- Reads NPM’s live database (read-only) — no export/import required
- Supports optional JSON config to label or hide entries
- Runs inside Docker with minimal setup

## ❗️ Dependencies
- Nginx Proxy Manager

## ⚙️ Setup

Make sure your Nginx Proxy Manager data is accessible to the container.

By default, this setup expects:
- NPM data at `/DATA/AppData/nginxproxymanager/data/` (this is a read-only mount)
- Config (e.g., `sites.json`) at `/DATA/AppData/npm_dash/` or wherever you keep your AppData

Make sure those paths exist and contain the expected files before launching the container.

### Example Config (sites.json)

[
  { "url": "internal.example.com", "label": "Internal Site", "hide": false },
  { "url": "test.example.com", "hide": true }
]

## 🐳 Running the App

docker compose up -d --build

Then visit:

`http://your-server-ip:6565`
`
⚠️ Use http:// — not https:// — unless you’ve added a reverse proxy.

## 🛠️ Notes

- The app listens on port `5555` inside the container, mapped to `6565` outside.
- Flask binds to `0.0.0.0` so it’s reachable on your LAN.
- Don’t hit it with https:// unless you're proxying through Nginx Proxy Manager with SSL.
